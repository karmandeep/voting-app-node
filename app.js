//With ES6 there is something called template literals.

//Template Literals make it easier to build string, to concatinate strings together

//Template Literal
//It let me insert javascript code without having to stop the string and use
//Pluses to concatinate and everything else.


//This is a Lot faster and easier and less prone to mistakes.
